This gif shows the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation associated to the Stochastic DE given by $dX_t = \mu ( X_t, t ) dt + \sigma ( X_t, t ) dW_t$ (LaTeX source code)
where $\mu(x,t) = \sin( 2 \pi x / L )$ and where $\sigma(x,t)$ is a constant value w.r.t x and t

-- dW_t is the differential form of the 'Wiener-Process'

The probability distribution takes non-zero values for 0 <= x <= L, and vanishes otherwise.
The derivative w.r.t x is taken to vanish at the end points x=0 and x=L (Neumann boundary conditions)

The initial distribution has all of its mass contained within the leftmost half of the domain
